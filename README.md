## About Me
Hello World! My name‚Äôs Christian, and I‚Äôve always been someone that loves a good challenge. Whether it is leading a group of marines, teaching a classroom full of 8 year olds, or diving into complex data sets, I‚Äôve discovered that my best work comes to me when I‚Äôm solving problems. 

Over the last 15 years, I‚Äôve had a wide assortment of experiences: Marine, Teacher, Accountant, Analyst, Web Developer, and now aspiring data scientist. Each job I‚Äôve held has taught me something unique, and all together they have given me a strong foundation in leadership, adaptability, resilience (those 8 year olds definitely can be overstimulating), and a love of data. If there is a way to make life better through spreadsheets, data visualizations, or teamwork, I‚Äôm your guy!

Currently I‚Äôm studying Analytics at Georgia Institute of Technology. I‚Äôm learning about machine learning, data modeling, and programming with Python, R, and SQL. I am also working diligently through Angela Yu‚Äôs 100 Days of Code, because why stop at one way of growth? I believe that we should constantly strive to improve, whether it is learning new skills or refining old ones. 

Outside of work and school, I enjoy weightlifting, playing guitar, Jiu Jitsu, spending time outdoors, and dancing. I‚Äôm the kind of person who gets way too excited about a good graph or chart, loves a good laugh, and firmly believes in Benjamin Franklin‚Äôs advice that ‚Äúfailure to prepare is preparing to fail.‚Äù I‚Äôve got a spreadsheet for almost everything, and I‚Äôm not even sorry about it.

Ultimately, I want to do work that matters. This could be helping a team, solving difficult problems, or contributing to something better than myself.
